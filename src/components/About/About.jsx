            Innovation is the change that unlocks new value. The crusade for
            innovation however is one that cannot be traversed alone. Sharing
            knowledge with the world is one of the cornerstones of innovation
            and this principle is realized with "HackTrix Meet-UP". Learn from
            various speakers hailing from various industries. These speakers are
            some of the most experienced professionals in their field, a diverse
            panel of individuals indeed because knowledge shared should not be
            kept exclusive to a field and its people, but instead be within
            reach of all those who wish to pursue it.
